                    <br> ---  `var` has function-level scope, which means it is accessible throughout the function in which it is declared and can also be hoisted, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
                    <br>---- `let` and `const` have block-level scope, restricting their accessibility to the block in which they are defined, providing better control and predictability, and they are not hoisted. 
                    <br>--- `let` allows reassignment, while `const` does not..</p>

                    <br>--- nulll is explicitly set by developers to represent the intentional absence of a value, often used when a variable or object property should have no value or to reset a variable's value. 
                    <br>--- undefined typically indicates that a variable or object property hasn't been assigned a value yet, and it's also the default value of function parameters that weren't provided when the function was called.</p>

                    <br> --- REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to interact with resources (data) through a stateless communication protocol. REST APIs enable clients (e.g., web applications) to request and manipulate data resources from a server in a standardized and scalable manner. They follow principles of simplicity, statelessness, and a uniform interface for easy integration and communication between different software systems.</p>
